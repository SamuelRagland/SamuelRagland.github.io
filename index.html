                <p id="history">I am a Kansas City Native and have only lived in another city for roughly two years of my life. I got into coding through an engineering class that had a lesson where you would work on coding solutions on a python-esque language.</p>
                <p id="education">I graduated from Shawnee Mission East in 2018 with a Presidential Scholars Award. From there I went into engineering at Missouri State University and spent a year and a half there before realising I enjoyed coding. After talking to friends about their fields in coding I decided to pursue a degree in Web Development from JCCC. This is my final semester there before I will receive my AAS in Web Development and Digital Media</p>
                <p id="hobbies">When I'm not coding I like to be active and be creative. The main outlets I partake in for this expression would in the form of soccer and art. Soccer has been my favorite sport ever since I can remember and I stay involved by playing in pick-up leagues or just practicing. Origami is an ancient style of art that I love to relax with because of how calming and satisfying the process is. Graphic design also tends to eat up a fair amount of my free time, this is because of the immense level of detail that I can develop in a work.</p>
                <p>Farming is so fun</p>
